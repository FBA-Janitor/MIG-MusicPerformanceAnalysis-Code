# Dataloader

## Core 
- Support loader functionality, mimick that of Torch, but all in numpy
- All utils and preprocessing happens here

## Torch
- Barebone wrapper of core to make the dataset compatible with Torch/Lightning

## Structure
- Dataset (e.g. f0 with labels; audio with labels; audio and f0 with labels)
  - Initialize necessary subdatasets (e.g. f0; labels; audio)
    - Domain-specific processing happens in subdataset
    - Subdatasets are then chained into a dataset of dicts/tuples
  - Dataset takes list of student ids for creation
    - This list can be generated by a separate util functions for specific filtering ops

## Existing functions

See: https://github.com/pseshadri9/contrastive-music-performance-assessment

Most of the functions from the old dataloader will be ported over. The "location" may change. A function prototype will be placed at the location where it will move to.
