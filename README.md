# Music Performance Analysis (MPA) Code Repository
This repository contains the the source code for the various MPA tasks carried out using the Florida all-state auditions dataset. The dataset is available on request from the Florida Bandmasters Association (FBA).

## Usage
This repository is meant to be used with the [MIG-FbaData repository](https://github.com/GTCMT/MIG-FbaData) and both should be cloned at the same folder level. It also needs the FBA dataset containing the audition recordings at the same folder level
